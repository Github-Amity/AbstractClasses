# AbstractClasses
A Java project on abstract classes

## What to know
Before you begin this project, you need to be familiar with abstract classes and method in Java.
  
If you are not familiar with it already, watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvPlEJ3LHgE) tutorial. 
  
It is highly recommended to type and run the code along with the video on any IDE or using an online compiler such as [online-java.com](https://www.online-java.com/online_java_compiler).
